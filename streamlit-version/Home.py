st.markdown("""
            <div class='section'><h3> Brief Overview</h3><p>The Bidirectional Sign Language Communication System is an innovative application designed to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and those who rely on spoken or written language. By leveraging advanced technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing, the system facilitates seamless, real-time translation in both directions: from sign language to speech/text and vice versa.<br>
            <br>In the <b>Sign-to-Speech/Text</b> mode, the system captures hand gestures using a camera, processes these inputs to recognize specific signs, and then converts them into corresponding spoken words or text. Conversely, in the <b>Speech/Text-to-Sign</b> mode, the application takes spoken or written language as input and translates it into sign language, displaying the appropriate gestures visually. This bidirectional functionality ensures effective communication, promoting inclusivity and understanding between sign language users and non-signers.<br>
            <br> The application is designed with user-friendliness in mind, featuring an intuitive interface that allows users to select their preferred mode of communication easily. Its real-time processing capabilities ensure that conversations flow naturally, without significant delays. By providing a tool that accommodates both sign language and spoken/written language, the system aims to foster more inclusive interactions across diverse communication preferences.
